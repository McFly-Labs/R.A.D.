# Scouting ideas for drones

 **Be aware of airspace restrictions** such as Federal/provincial parks.

 ## Campfire extinquisher

 Mini firefighter game, have youth take turns 'water bombing' for a suitable height?

 * see Watering drone
 * consider risk of heat damage, updraft causing loss of control

 ## Garden Survey

 * Need group ideas of what you can survey for and how to detect it (weeds, plant yellowing, soil cracking due to lack of irrigation, pests, etc)

 ## Pin the star on the tree

 Might be a fun holiday activity but will requre a way to get the stars back down
 Needs a release mechanism

 ## Lash a helipad

 Not strictly building flight skills but useful to illustrate the challenges and considerations needed around UAVs

 * unstable platform means rougher landings, hard takeoffs
 * wider flat top makes for easier time
 * where to ditch safely if your landing platform falls down
 * hang flags for as a wind indicator

 ## Conservation Spotter

 ## Mock search and rescue

 Practice using drone to spot someone laying in grass, etc
 Follow up, team work on implementing object detection for an automatic survey

 ## Watering drone

 Use a reel or other retractable hose for a pickup, allowing landing on a platform over a water tank/rain barrel to auto fill.   Pump will need to self prime or have enough draw to pull water up the hose.
 Water with pump + spray nozzle or just a gravity fed valve and "watering can head" like a rain shower (servo/actuator control vs running motor to save power)
