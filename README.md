# R.A.D.
Risk Assessing Drone

# Goal
To make farmers fields safer in countries that have experienced conflict by locating unexploded ordinance in their fields. We hope to accomplish this by designing and integrating multiple detection methods into a drone based platform, including a gas sensor, thermal imaging, image recognition, and a deployable 'metal' detector.
